#####WebApplication:

Step1: Our Website Application named "WebApplication" is located in "Smart Room Project Code >> Web Application Code >> WebApplication" folder.
       Please copy this project "WebApplication" to you C drive so that the new location for this web application will be "C:\WebApplication"
	   *** This is mandatory as we are using text file to save some user information

Step2: Now you need to start Tomcat server before opening the web application 

Step3: After starting Tomcat server, Please open "WebApplication" project from you C drive using NetBeans IDE

Step4: Now Run the "WebApplication" project. You will have a login page.
       Give Username: user1
	        Password: user1
		
       After login you can see the home page for user1 where user1 can see his/her home electric devices running status.
	   You can control the devices from this page.


#####Desktop Software Application:	   

Step5: Our Desktop Software Application named "JavaFXApplicationSmartRoom" is located in "Smart Room Project Code >> Software Application Code >> JavaFXApplicationSmartRoom"
       Just open "JavaFXApplicationSmartRoom" project using NetBeans.

Step6: You may need to add "jssc" jar file in this project which is given in "Help Files or Project Manual>>jSSC-2.8.0"	 folder
       Just add the jssc.jar file from the folder "Help Files or Project Manual>>jSSC-2.8.0"  

Step7: Now Run the "JavaFXApplicationSmartRoom" application. You will have a login form.
       Give Username: user1
            Password: user1	
       After login you can see a form showing the electric devices running status for user1. You can control the devices from this form.
       The Web Application will also start receiving home devices status from the desktop application.


***Without using any hardware configuration you can run the website and software 
  [Without hardware/Arduino connection we are assuming all the electric devices running condition is OFF]

  
#####Hardware Arduino:

Step8: You need to connect a micro-controller Arduino uno via usb port in your Desktop/Laptop Computer. For usb port we are using COM Port7 as a default port

Step9: Now you have to burn the code in "SmartHome.ino" file to Arduino uno micro-controller.
       This code is written for the circuit connection which contains three LED lights with individual switch.

****** For project simulation all these hardwares are available in our collection.
